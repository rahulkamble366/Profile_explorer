Design and implement a web application using the Angular or React framework that allows users to view a list of profiles and interactively explore the addresses of each profile on a map. The application aims to provide an intuitive and user-friendly way to navigate through profiles and visualise the geographic locations associated with each individual.

The key functionalities of the application include:

1.Profile Display: Create a webpage that presents a collection of profiles, each comprising essential information such as the person's name, photograph, and a brief description.

2.Interactive Mapping: Incorporate an interactive map component that can dynamically display addresses based on user interactions. This map will allow users to see the geographical location associated with each profile.

3.Summary Integration: Implement a "Summary" button adjacent to each profile. Clicking this button should trigger the display of the map component with a marker indicating the precise address of the selected profile.

4.(Good to have ) Map Services Integration: Utilise external map services like Google Maps or Mapbox to integrate the mapping functionality into the application. This entails setting up markers and correctly rendering addresses on the map.

5.User-Friendly Experience: Ensure that the application offers a smooth and intuitive user experience, enabling users to easily navigate profiles and access mapped addresses without confusion.

6.Profile Data Management : Allow administrators to add, edit, or delete profiles. This will require an admin panel or dashboard to manage the profile data efficiently.

7.Search and Filter Functionality : Provide users with the ability to search and filter profiles based on different criteria, such as name, location, or other attributes. This enhances the usability of the application.

8.Responsive Design :  Ensure that the application is responsive and mobile-friendly so that users can access it from various devices, including smartphones and tablets.

9.Error Handling Implement robust error handling and validation mechanisms to handle issues gracefully, such as invalid addresses or failed map service requests.

10.Loading Indicators : Include loading indicators of progress bars to give users feedback when the application is fetching data or rendering the map.

11.Profile Details: Create a separate profile details view that provides more in-depth information about each profile when a user clicks on a profile card. This can include additional details like contact information, interests, etc.

By considering these additional points, you can create a more robust and user-friendly web application that meets the needs of both users and administrators while ensuring its long-term viability and success.

The successful completion of this project will result in a fully functional web application that demonstrates proficiency in utilising Angular's capabilities to create an engaging interface for profile viewing and location mapping. The application will offer an innovative solution for users interested in exploring the geographic distribution of profiles, enhancing user engagement and interaction.
